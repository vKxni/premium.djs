# Discord.js v14 Template | TypeScript

Back after a small break, I deprecated the v13 and now updated the code-base to v14. 


> ### 🤷‍♂️ What?

A simple Discord bot template for Discord.js v14. It's written in TypeScript and uses MongoDB as a database. It also has a few commands and events already implemented to get started. 

> ### 📝 Tech

- Discord.js v14.8
- TypeScript
- Typegoose (MongoDB)
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Jest (Testing)
- Docker
- EditorConfig
